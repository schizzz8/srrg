# srrg_gl_helpers

This package contains miscellaneous utilities to draw stuff in opengl,
such as ellipses, triangles, cubes, reference systems and so on.
It is a standalone lib, and only depends on opengl.

## Setting up
Just copy the node in your ros_package_path and do cmakelists.txt
All functions are specified in the header and they do what you expect them to do.
glDrawEllipse(...) draws an ellipse, and so on.
