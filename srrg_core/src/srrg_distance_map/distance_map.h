    It is a grid of DistanceMapCells, stored as an Eigen Matrix
    A Distance map is a grid that for each cell contains: the distance from the closest occupied cell AND the identity of the closest cell

    The typical use is the following:


    \code{.cpp}
    occupied_cells = ...;// vector of pairs denoting the occupied cells
    // prepare an int image and set all occupied cells
    IntImage input_indices(rows,cols);
    input_indices=-1; // clean the int image
    for(size_t i=0; i<occupied_cells.size(); i++){ 
       const std::pair<int,int> occupied_cell=occupied_cells[i];
       input_indics.at<int>(occupied_cell->first, occupied_cell->second)=i // mark the points in the occupied cells;
    }
    DistanceMap dmap;
    FloatImage distances;
    IntImage   closest_point_indices;

    dmap.compute(closest_point_indices, distances, input_indices, max_distance);

    
    \endcode
    here closest_point_indices is an int_image that contains in the cell [i,j] the index
    (meaning the position in the array) closest to the location i,j, while 
    distances[i,j] contains the distance from the point at i,j and the closest occupied cell.
    max_distance is the squared distance where to stop the expansion
