# ODOM_PARAMS is used for the odometry related parameters
# put the parameters in the same order they are used to compute the
# robot motion in the kinematics class
# example for a differential drive robot:
#
# ODOM_PARAMS -0.5 0.5 0.2
#
# be sure to select at least the correct signs for right and left ticks
# (custom platforms usually report inverse signs between kl and kr since
#  a motor is placed upside down w.r.t. the other)
#
ODOM_PARAMS -0.5 0.5 0.4
#
# SENSOR2_PARAMS is used to set the initial guess of a 2d sensor.
# you can put as many SENSOR2_PARAMS as you have.
# use it as
# SENSOR2_PARAMS frame child_frame x y theta
# where x and y are in meters, and theta is in radians
# example with a 2d sensor placed exactly at the center of the platform
#
# SENSOR2_PARAMS /odom /laser 0 0 0
#
SENSOR2_PARAMS /odom /laser_frame 0.1 0 0
#
# SENSOR3_PARAMS is used to set the initial guess of a 3d sensor.
# you can put as many SENSOR3_PARAMS as you have.
# use it as
# SENSOR3_PARAMS frame child_frame x y z qx qy qz
# where x, y and z are in meters, and qx, qy, qz express the values of a quaternion.
# The solver is not able to solve the z value (yet), so put there a more precise guess,
# the system will consider it as a fixed value.
# example with a 3d sensor placed exactly at the center of the platform
# with its own z-axis pointing forward (i.e. a camera)
#
# SENSOR3_PARAMS /base_link /camera_front 0 0 0.26 -0.47 0.52 -0.51
#
# while the following is a 3d sensor placed upside down, with its own
# z-axis pointing forward
#
# SENSOR3_PARAMS /odom /camera_left 0 0 0.35 0.47 0.52 0.51
#
#
SENSOR3_PARAMS /odom /camera_frame_rgb 0 0 0.3 -0.47 0.52 -0.51
#SENSOR3_PARAMS /odom /camera_left 0 0 0.35 0.47 0.52 0.51
#SENSOR3_PARAMS /odom /camera_right 0 0 0.35 0.47 0.52 0.51
