      <H1>What to tune in the joints?</H2>
      Here you will connect the encoders, veryfy the H bridge and check that all connections are properly made.
      The process is incremental, you will check the things one at a time while doing them. If you make some mistake
      the probablity that you damage some hardware is rather small.
    </p>
    <p>
      <H3> Connecting and checking the encoders </H3>
      You need to connect the encoders to arduino and verify if they are correctly sensed.
      Here are the connections:
      <ul>
	Power (for both motors)
	<ul>
	  <li> power (+5v), is the <b>blue</b> wire on the motors. It can go to any of the +5v outputs of the arduino. </li>
 	  <li> GND (+5v), is the <b> green </b>  wire on the motors. It can go to any of the +5v outputs of the arduino. </li>
	</ul>
 	<li> right motor </li> 
	<ul>
	  <li> phase_a, is the <b>yellow</b> wire, on pin 50 of arduino. </li>
 	  <li> phase_b, is the <b>white</b> wire, on pin 51 of arduino </li>
	</ul>
 	<li> left motor </li> 
	<ul>
	  <li> phase_a, is the <b>yellow</b> wire, on pin 52 of arduino. </li>
 	  <li> phase_b, is the <b>white</b> wire, on pin 53 of arduino </li>
	</ul>
      </ul>
    
      Once you have done the above connection you can check if it works by manually rotating the wheels.
      If you go on the <a href="orazio_joints.html?joints" target="_parent"> Joints </a> page you should be able
      to see the numbers in the field <i>encoder_position</i> changing when you rotate the wheel.
      They should when you rotate in one direction and decrease when you rotate in the other.<br/>
      If this is not the case, you made something wrong with the connections. Check them again,
      and connect the motors one at a time.

    </p>
 
   <p>
     <H3> Connecting and checking the H bridge </H3>
     Done with the encoders? It is now time to connect the H bridge. If you use the arduino motor board,
     there is not much you have to do, besides stacking the board on the arduino.
     
     If you use some other H bridge, you will have to connect
     <ul>
       <li> Groud: the logical ground of the board and the arduino.</li>
       <li> For each motor at least two wires. The meaning of the wires depends ont he
	 type of the  bridge. You should have already configured the motor mode while
	 configuring the <a href="orazio_system.html?system" target="_parent"> System </a>. <br/>
	 We now list the connections you have to made for an L298N bridge like the one
	 in the marrtino page. This is controlled in dual PWM mode (mode 1).
	 <ul>
	   <li> L298N-In1 -> PWM pin 2 </li>
	   <li> L298N-In2 -> PWM pin 3 </li>
	   <li> L298N-In3 -> PWM pin 4 </li>
	   <li> L298N-In4 -> PWM pin 5 </li>
	   <li> L298N-GND -> Arduino Ground </li>
	 </ul>
       </li>
     </ul>
     After connecting the H bridge, but without connecting the motor power, we can test
     if everything is right using a tester. <br/>
     To this end, power the H bridge by connecting the battery in to a 12V source. <br\>
     It is convenient to disable the watchdog, by setting to 0 the watchdog_cycles in 
     <a href="orazio_system.html?system" target="_parent"> System </a>.
     In this way the control we send to the board will be executed forever and we have more
     time for debugging. <br\>
     With a tester at hand measure the voltage in the motor outputs of the encoder.
     
     Issue a "255 0" in the PWM_speed caption, and measure the voltage. You should
     get a high value. Be sure you are measuring the correct output, you have 2 motors.
     Issue a "-255 0", and check the voltage. You should a number having an opposite sign
     w.r.t before (you are giving a negative voltage after all). <br/>

     Now test the other channel, by issuing "0 255" and "0 -255", and see if the outputs
     are consistent.
     Finally issue a "0 0" and measure again the outputs. They should be around zero both.<br/>
   
     If this does not work, you might have made a mistake. 
     Check the wires again, and be sure the H bridge is
     of the correct type.
   </p>
   
   <p>
     <H3> Connecting the motors </H3>
     Ok, the bridge is working, time to see the wheels moving. Connect
     the motors to the output channels of the bridge.  Here are the
     connections for our two types of H bridge:
     <ul>
       <li>Arduino Motor Board
	 <ul>
	   <li>Motor shield out - motors (red + /black -) </li>
	 </ul>
       </li>
       <li>L298N
	 <ul>
	   <li>L298N Out1 - Left Motor black</li>
	   <li>L298N Out2 - Left Motor red</li>
	   <li>L298N Out3 - Right Motor black</li>
	   <li>L298N Out4 - Right Motor red</li>
	 </ul>
     </ul>
     Here you can basically make the following mistakes:
     <ul>
       <li>swapping the motors</li>
       <li>inverting the motor polarity</li>
     </ul>
     None of the above mistakes is destructive, and they can be easily
     fixed.  With the motors connected, issue a "100 0" in the pwm box
     of the <a href="orazio_joints.html?joints" target="_parent">
     Joints </a> page.
     You should see one of the motors running in one direction.
     Check that the <i>encoder_position</i> of the joint 0 is changing.
     If this not the case you swapped the motors, and you have to swap the
     left and the right motor <br/>.
     
     Another thing you should check is that the number reported in
     "desired_speed" for a joint has the same sign of the pwm you
     issue. "100 0" should result in a positive desired speed, while
     "-100 0" should result in a negative one.  If this is not the
     case, swap the polarity of the motor on the H bridge. <br/>

     Repeat the test for the other motor, issuing "0 100" and "0 -100" in the pwm_speed field.
     Once all is working you can go to the next step. <br/>
   </p>
    
    
   <p>
     <H3> Open Loop Tuning </H3>
     Another parameter that is relevant for controlling a motor is the "detach current".
     Motors require a minimum voltage to rotate. If you issue a voltage below that level,
     the motor will not move and consime power anyway. We don't like this.
     So we need to find the minimum voltage (that in our case is the PWM value) to
     issue to the motor and expect a movement.
     To find this value for each motor individually, start incrementing the pwm command
     from "0" to "N" in steps of 10. The <i>pwm_min</i> value is the minimum value for which the motor
     moves.
     Save this value as "pwm_min" in the corresponding joint parameter.
     For "pwm_max" you can leave the default value.
   </p>

    <p>
      <H3> PID tuning </H3>
      The motors are controlled in closed loop, and they get the feedback from the encoder.
      This means during normal operation,  you tell the encoder a speed expressed as
      ticks per cycle, and the controller will adjust the PWM to match that
      value.
      Normally the parameters of the PID in the default configuration are adequate.
      For a better tuning you can just follow a  PID tuning tutorial on the web.<br/>
      
      Still you can check that the PID does a decent job.
      Issue a "10 0" on the "desired_speed" for the joint 0. You should see
      the "desired_speed" in the status_box, and the "encoder_speed" reaching similar values.
      Try to brake the motor, and you will see that the controller will increase the PWM
      to keep the speed at a desired level.
      
      Do the same with the other motor,
      You are done with the joints.. 
    </p>
    
    <H2>If you reach this step, and all goes well, save the parameters on the EEPROM. Press the button on the bottom of the Joints page.</H2>
