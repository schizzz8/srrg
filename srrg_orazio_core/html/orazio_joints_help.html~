      <H2>What to tune in the joints?</H2>
      Here you will connect the encoders, veryfy the H bridge and check that all connections are properly made.
      The process is incremental, you will check the things one at a time while doing them. If you make some mistake
      the probablity that you damage some hardware is rather small.

      <H3> Connecting and checnking the encoders </H3>
      You need to connect the encoders to arduino and verify if they are correctly sensed.
      First you need to power up the encoders, by connecting the red and black wires to the +5v and the GND pins on the
      arduino.
