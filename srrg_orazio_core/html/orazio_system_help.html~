      <H2>What to tune in the system?</H2>
    </p>
    <p>
    The system parameters include general settings of the controller, the communication and the type of H bridge you use. <br/>
    On this page you typically need only to select the right type of
    H bridge in your system. This is the <b> motor_mode </b> parameter.
    Currently we support two types of bridges:
    <ul>
      <li><b>PWM and DIR (motor_mode=0)</b>: these include all
	H bridges that are controlled with 2 pins. One issues the PWM,
	the other one tells the direction. The <b>arduino motor board</b> is
	a notable example of PWM and DIR controller.
      </li>
      <li><b>DUAL PWM (motor_mode=1)</b>: these bridges use two wires that are mutually exclusive and control two directions of rotation. To get the motor rotating in a direction, they issue the PWM on the corresponding pin and leave the other one to 0.  
      </li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
    <H2>IMPORTANT</H2>
    Set the correct motor mode before connecting the H Bridge,
    and save the parameter to the eeprom.
