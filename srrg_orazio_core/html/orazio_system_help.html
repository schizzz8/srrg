      <H2>What to tune in the system?</H2>
    The system parameters include general settings of the controller, the communication and the type of H bridge you use. <br/>
    </p>

    <p> <H3>motor_mode</H3> <br>
    On this page you typically need only to select the right type of
    H bridge in your system. This is the <b> motor_mode </b> parameter.
    Currently we support two types of bridges:
    <ul>
      <li><b>PWM and DIR (motor_mode=0)</b>: these include all
	H bridges that are controlled with 2 pins. One issues the PWM,
	the other one tells the direction. The <b>arduino motor board</b> is
	a notable example of PWM and DIR controller.
      </li>
      <li><b>DUAL PWM (motor_mode=1)</b>: these bridges use two wires that are mutually exclusive and control two directions of rotation. To get the motor rotating in a direction, they issue the PWM on the corresponding pin and leave the other one to 0.  
      </li>
    </ul>
    After setting the motor mode it is usually safe to connect the H bridge and the motors.

   <b>IMPORTANT</b><br/>
    Set the correct motor mode before connecting the H Bridge,
    and save the parameter to the eeprom.
   
    
    <p> <H3>watchdog_cycles</H3>
    Another parameter that is relevant is the watchdog. This number controls the number of cycles the robot can tolerate the lack of communication from the host. If the host is silent for more than <i>watchdog_cycles</i>, the robot assumes something went wrong on the PC side and turns off the motors. USually this is set to 50 cycles, that means half a second. During the calibration you can disable the watchdog, by setting it to 0. <b>Remember to enable the watchdog again
      after calibration, otherwise your robot will follow the last command forever, even if the PC crashes</b>
