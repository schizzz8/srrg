      <H2>What to tune in the kinematics?</H2>
      Here we will tell our robot how big it is and how large its wheel are.
      We will also asjust the acceleration ramps to tradeoff battery-consumption,
      reactivity and smoothness.

      Normally we would
      like to control our robot in standard units, with translational
      velocities expressed as meters per second, and rotational
      velocities expressed in radiants per second.  So far our
      universe consists of encoder ticks and PWM values.  Still the
      system internally has to deal with these quantities, but we want
      to expose a more abstract interface.  To this extent we need to
      relate meters and seconds to encoder ticks (that seems to be the
      universal measure in our little firmware world, like king's arm
      for measuring the distances).

      At the end of this section we will be able to impose to the base
      velocities in standard units.
